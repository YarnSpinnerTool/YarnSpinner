# Contributing to Yarn Spinner

Hi there! We're thrilled that you'd like to contribute to this project. Your help is essential for keeping it great.

## How to send in your contributions

There are many ways you can send your contributions to Yarn Spinner. You can either **report a bug**, or you can make the changes yourself and **submit a pull request**!

### Reporting bugs and opening issues

Please [report bugs](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/issues) and open issues generously. Don't be afraid that your idea is silly, or you're reporting a duplicate. We're happy to hear from you. Seriously.

> ***Please Note:*** Yarn Spinner is written by volunteers. If you encounter a problem while using it, we'll do our best to help you, but neither the authors, or Secret Lab Pty. Ltd. can offer any support.

### Submitting a pull request

* [Fork](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/fork) and clone the repository
* Create a new branch: git checkout -b my-branch-name
* Make your changes
* Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner/compare)
* Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed.

If you're unfamiliar with how pull requests work, [GitHub's documentation on them](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) is very good.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Update the documentation as necessary, as well as making code changes.
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
* [Write a good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

### Branches

All of Yarn Spinner's in-progress work happens on the `main` branch. When we make a release, we create a new release directly from `main`. This means that `main` is always in a state of flux.

### Code and other contributions

Contributions to Yarn Spinner (via pull request or otherwise) must be licensed under the MIT license.
