The functionality that is described by the interface can be adopted by any type, regardless of where the type appears in the inheritance hierarchy. A type implements an interface by providing implementations for the members of the interface.

If the design requires other types for the index, reconsider whether the type represents a logical data store. If it does not represent a logical data store, use a method. \\\cline{1-7}

If the type implements I\-Equatable$<$\-T$>$, and therefore offers the method T.\-Equals(\-T), and if the argument is known at compile time to be of type T, then the compiler can call I\-Equatable$<$\-T$>$.\-Equals(\-T) instead of Object.\-Equals(object), and no cast is necessary, improving performance. \\\cline{1-7}

41 &C\-A1200 &Avoid using cref tags with a prefix &Documentation &True &True &Use of cref tags with prefixes should be avoided, since it prevents the compiler from verifying references and the I\-D\-E from updating references during refactorings. It is permissible to suppress this error at a single documentation site if the cref must use a prefix because the type being mentioned is not findable by the compiler. For example, if a cref is mentioning a special attribute in the full framework but you're in a file that compiles against the portable framework, or if you want to reference a type at higher layer of Roslyn, you should suppress the error. You should not suppress the error just because you want to take a shortcut and avoid using the full syntax. \\\cline{1-7}

149 &C\-A5360 &Do Not Call Dangerous Methods In Deserialization &Security &True &False &Insecure Deserialization is a vulnerability which occurs when untrusted data is used to abuse the logic of an application, inflict a Denial-\/of-\/\-Service (Do\-S) attack, or even execute arbitrary code upon it being deserialized. It’s frequently possible for malicious users to abuse these deserialization features when the application is deserializing untrusted data which is under their control. Specifically, invoke dangerous methods in the process of deserialization. Successful insecure deserialization attacks could allow an attacker to carry out attacks such as Do\-S attacks, authentication bypasses, and remote code execution. \\\cline{1-7}
