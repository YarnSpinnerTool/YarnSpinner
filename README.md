# Yarn Spinner

<img src="https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/Documentation/YarnSpinnerLogo.png" alt="Yarn Spinner logo" width="100px;" align="right">

**[Yarn](https://github.com/infiniteammoinc/Yarn)** is a language that's designed to make it *super easy* to create interactive dialogue for games. Yarn's very similar in style to [Twine](http://twinery.org), so if you already know that, you'll be right at home! If you don't, that's cool - Yarn's syntax is extremely minimal, and there's not much there to learn. The Yarn language is used in a number of cool games, including [Night In The Woods](http://nightinthewoods.com) and [Knights and Bikes](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/foamsword/knights-and-bikes). 

**Yarn Spinner** interprets the Yarn language, and is written in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29). Yarn Spinner is designed to be easy to add to [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com) games, but it's also intended for use in other contexts as well.

> ***Important:*** Yarn Spinner is still under development, and we haven't made our 1.0 release yet. It's *probably* fine to use right now, but there are a few bits and pieces that might change between now and first release.
