# Yarn Spinner

**Yarn Spinner** is a tool for creating interactive dialogue for games. 

Write your conversations in *Yarn*, a simple programming language that's designed to be easy for writers to learn, while also powerful enough to handle whatever you need. 

Yarn's similar in style to [Twine](http://twinery.org), so if you already know that, you'll be right at home! If you don't, that's cool - Yarn's syntax is extremely minimal, and there's not much there to learn.
