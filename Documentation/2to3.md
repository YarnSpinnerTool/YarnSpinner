# Yarn Spec 3 Proposals

This document lists features that were accepted into the Yarn 3 language specification. If a feature is listed here, it may or may not mean that it has already been implemented by the official YarnSpinner runtime.

The purpose of this document is severalfold:
- document features that were already added to YarnSpinner since 2021-09-30 when the Yarn 2 language specification was published;
- serve as a roadmap for future language development;
- allow multiple language runtime implementations (including unofficial ones) to know what features are currently being developed, or will be added in the future, thus making it easier for them to implement those features at their own pace;
- it will also make writing Yarn 3 spec much easier when we are ready to publish it.

Items that are included in this list could be:
- new language features;
- changes to existing language features;
- features that already exist in YarnSpinner but were not properly documented in [Yarn 2](Yarn-Spec.md) spec, or documented incorrectly.
