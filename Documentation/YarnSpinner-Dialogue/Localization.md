# LOCALIZATION
Yarn Spinner provides tools to help convert your game in to any language you like. This is achieved by usage of the [YarnSpinnerConsole](../YarnSpinnerConsole) tool. At the moment, this tool is not available standalone and needs to be [built from source](../YarnSpinner-Programming/Building.md).

## Localization procedure

1. We first use the tool to place unique **taglines** on each line of text that the end user will see. To do this, we execute the tool with the **taglines** command, eg:  `YarnSpinnerConsole.exe taglines MyYarnFile.yarn.txt`.

2. Next, we use the tool to generate a file of strings (**genstrings**) in '[comma separated value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)' (csv) format. `YarnSpinnerConsole.exe genstrings MyYarnFile.yarn.txt` will generate a file, (in this example MyYarnFIle.yarn_lines.csv), that can then distributed to translators. It is recommended that this file first be renamed using a language identifier before distribution, eg
    ```
    MyYarnFIle.yarn_lines.enAU.csv
    MyYarnFIle.yarn_lines.ptTL.csv
    ```
3. When the file is returned from translators, we then use Yarn Spinner's DialogueRunner inside Unity to set String Groups for the required language.

## Footnotes
* While not essential that all files follow a standard, but highly recommended that consistency of format be used across all localization files within a project eg [ISO-15897](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:15897:ed-2:v1:en)
* Originally, Yarn Spinner used .json format. The Yarn Spinner Console can convert this json format to the new improved text format: `YarnSpinnerConsole.exe convert --yarn Ship.json`
* Command reference is available for YarnSpinnerConsole.exe by either running it with no arguments or by utilizing the help command (`YarnSpinnerConsole.exe help`). Help for each command is available by using 'help command' (eg `YarnSpinnderConsole.exe help compile`)
