## Tutorial

> ***Note:*** This tutorial assumes that you know a little bit about [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com). In particular, it is helpful that you know how to get around the Unity editor, how to work with game objects, and how to write scripts in C#. If you don't know these things, please refer to [Unity's documentation](http://unity3d.com/learn).

## Yarn Spinner Quick Start

Here's how to quickly jump in to Yarn Spinner if you're already familiar with Unity.

* **Download** [the YarnSpinner package](https://github.com/thesecretlab/YarnSpinner/releases) into your Unity project.
* **Import** the package into your project.
* Inside the YarnSpinner folder, **open the `Examples/Yarn Spinner Basic Example` scene.**
* **Start the game.**
* **Play through the dialogue.**

Once you've played with it, open the Example Script file in the [Yarn Editor](http://github.com/infiniteammoinc/Yarn), (it's in the `Examples/Demo Assets` folder), and make some changes to the script. Once you've done that, take a look at how `Code/DialogueRunner.cs`, `Examples/Demo Scripts/ExampleDialogueUI.cs` and `Examples/Demo Scripts/ExampleVariableStorage.cs` work. You can also [add your own functions to Yarn](Extending.md).
